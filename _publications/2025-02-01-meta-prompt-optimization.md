excerpt: 'We propose Meta-Prompt Optimization (MPO), a novel framework that leverages Bayesian optimization to automatically optimize meta-prompts for LLM-based sequential decision making. MPO treats the meta-prompt as a hyperparameter and uses a surrogate model to efficiently search for the optimal meta-prompt that maximizes task performance.'
