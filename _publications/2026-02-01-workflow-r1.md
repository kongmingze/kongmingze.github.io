excerpt: 'We propose Workflow-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework for training LLM agents to construct multi-turn workflows. Our key innovation is Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), which enables credit assignment at the sub-sequence level, allowing the model to learn from intermediate steps in complex workflow construction tasks.'
