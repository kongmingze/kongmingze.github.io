excerpt: 'We study the problem of online clustering of dueling bandits (OCDB), where the goal is to simultaneously cluster users into groups based on their latent preference and identify the best arm for each group. We propose the first algorithm for OCDB, called OCDB-UCB, which achieves a regret bound that is sublinear in the number of users and the time horizon.'
