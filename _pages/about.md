# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Mingze Kong, currently a final-year undergraduate student in **Data Science** at Lanzhou University. I am also working as a Research Assistant at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhongxiang Dai](https://daizhongxiang.github.io/). Feel free to reach out to me via email: [mingzekong@cuhk.edu.cn](mailto:mingzekong@cuhk.edu.cn).

## Research Interests
- **ðŸ¤– Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**: Investigating how LLMs can act as decision-makers and reasoners in diverse and complex tasks.
- **ðŸŽ° Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) Problems**: Passionate about advancing both the theoretical foundations and data-driven algorithmic applications of MAB frameworks, focusing on efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs in uncertain and dynamic environments.
- **ðŸ“Š Mathematical Optimization and Decision Theory**: Leveraging optimization techniques and probabilistic reasoning to enhance the performance and robustness of machine learning algorithms.

Thank you for visiting my academic homepage!
