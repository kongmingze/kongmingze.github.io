# Welcome! 👋

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en) (CUHK-Shenzhen), where I am privileged to be advised by [Prof. Zhongxiang Dai](https://daizhongxiang.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Assistant in the same group. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Lanzhou University. For academic collaborations or inquiries, please feel free to reach me at [mingzekong@cuhk.edu.cn](mailto:mingzekong@cuhk.edu.cn).

## Research Interests

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Systems**: Exploring coordination, communication, and collaboration mechanisms among multiple intelligent agents to solve complex tasks in dynamic environments.
- **🧠 Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**: Investigating how LLMs can act as autonomous decision-makers and reasoners, enabling them to plan, execute, and adapt in diverse real-world scenarios.
- **🎮 Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Developing algorithms that enable agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with environments, with a focus on sample efficiency and generalization.
- **🎰 Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) Problems**: Advancing both theoretical foundations and practical applications of bandit algorithms, focusing on efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Thank you for visiting my academic homepage!
